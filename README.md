# Pyramid TicTacToe

## How to Run
To run the pyramid game, please make sure you have Python 3.10 or later. Run the pyramid.py file and then you can compete against the computer. The computer has a min-max algorithm where it decides if a certain move has a higher/lower utility. The algorithm helps decide which is the best move to use against the user. 

I created this in my CPSC481 - Artificial Intelligence class. I learned how to use a min-max algoritm in my programs.
